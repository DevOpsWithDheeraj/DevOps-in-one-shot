# üöÄ DevOps (Beginner to Advanced)

## üìò What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a combination of **Development (Dev)** and **Operations (Ops)** ‚Äî a culture and set of practices that aim to **bridge the gap** between software development and IT operations.  
The goal is to **deliver software faster, more reliably, and with continuous improvement**.

DevOps emphasizes:
- **Collaboration** between teams  
- **Automation** of repetitive tasks  
- **Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**  
- **Monitoring & Feedback loops** for improvement

## üß© 1. Git & Version Control

- Version Control concepts: Local, Centralized, Distributed  
- Git basics: init, clone, add, commit, push, pull  
- Branching & merging strategies  
- Pull requests and Git workflows (Gitflow, Trunk-Based)  
- Advanced concepts: stash, revert, reset, cherry-pick, tags  
- Integration with Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions  

**Hands-on Example:**  
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin <repo_url>
git push -u origin main
````

---

## üêß 2. Linux Fundamentals

* File system structure: `/`, `/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, `/opt`
* Basic commands: `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`, `mkdir`
* File permissions: `chmod`, `chown`, `id`, `groups`
* Process management: `ps`, `top`, `htop`, `kill`, `systemctl`
* Disk management: `df -h`, `du -sh`, `lsblk`, `fdisk`, `mount`
* Package management: `apt`, `yum`, `rpm`
* Shell scripting basics: automation with bash
* Monitoring & logs: `uptime`, `free -h`, `journalctl`, `tail -f`
* SSH & remote access: `ssh`, `scp`, key-based authentication

**Hands-on Example:**

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Deploying application..."
git pull origin main
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
echo "Deployment complete!"
```

---

## üåê 3. Networking in DevOps

**Networking is critical** in DevOps for deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

### Key Concepts:

* OSI & TCP/IP model basics
* IP addressing, Subnetting, NAT
* DNS: Domain names, Record types (A, CNAME, MX, TXT)
* HTTP/HTTPS protocols, SSL/TLS
* Load Balancers: ELB, Nginx, HAProxy
* Ports & protocols (80, 443, 22, 8080, etc.)
* Firewalls & Security Groups
* Network troubleshooting commands: `ping`, `traceroute`, `netstat`, `curl`, `nslookup`, `dig`

**Hands-on Example:**

```bash
ping google.com
curl -I https://myapp.com
netstat -tulnp | grep 80
nslookup example.com
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Build & CI/CD Tools

* CI/CD concepts: Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment
* Jenkins setup and configuration
* Jenkins pipelines: Freestyle vs Declarative (`Jenkinsfile`)
* GitHub Actions: workflows, jobs, runners, triggers
* Advanced CI/CD: Docker + Kubernetes integration, automated deployments
* Best practices: idempotent pipelines, secrets management, notifications

**Hands-on Example (Jenkinsfile):**

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Checkout') { steps { git 'https://github.com/DevOpsWithDheeraj/demo.git' } }
    stage('Build') { steps { sh 'mvn clean verify' } }
    stage('Docker Build') { steps { sh 'docker build -t dheeraj/demo-app:latest .' } }
    stage('Deploy') { steps { sh 'kubectl set image deployment/demo demo=dheeraj/demo-app:latest' } }
  }
}
```
