# 🌀 Agile & ITIL Practices 

## 📘 Introduction

Agile and ITIL practices complement DevOps by ensuring **structured, efficient, and iterative software delivery**.  
While **Agile** focuses on **flexible and iterative software development**, **ITIL** focuses on **IT service management (ITSM) and operational excellence**.

**Key Goals:**
- Faster software delivery  
- Continuous feedback and improvement  
- Standardized IT operations and support  
- Enhanced collaboration between teams

## 🧩 1. Agile Basics

**Agile Principles:**
- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools  
- Working software over comprehensive documentation  
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation  
- Responding to change over following a plan  

**Agile Practices in DevOps:**
- **Scrum:** Iterative sprints (2–4 weeks) with defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team)  
- **Kanban:** Visual workflow management, focus on continuous delivery  
- **User Stories & Backlogs:** Capture requirements as small, testable tasks  

---

### 🔹 Example: Agile in DevOps

**Scenario:** Development of Node.js Web App

1. **Sprint Planning:** Create backlog items for features  
2. **Daily Standup:** Discuss progress, blockers, and tasks  
3. **Sprint Execution:** Implement features using CI/CD pipelines  
4. **Review & Retrospective:** Validate features, capture improvements  

✅ Agile ensures **frequent feedback and rapid delivery** in DevOps.

## 🧩 2. ITIL Basics

**ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)** provides **best practices for IT service management (ITSM)**.  

**Core ITIL Components:**
- **Service Strategy:** Define IT service goals and strategy  
- **Service Design:** Plan services with SLAs, availability, capacity  
- **Service Transition:** Build, test, and deploy services  
- **Service Operation:** Monitor and maintain services  
- **Continual Service Improvement (CSI):** Optimize services continuously

### 🔹 ITIL Practices in DevOps

| ITIL Practice | DevOps Integration |
|---------------|------------------|
| Incident Management | Monitor production systems & trigger alerts |
| Problem Management | Root cause analysis using logs & monitoring tools |
| Change Management | Controlled deployment of code via pipelines |
| Configuration Management | Track servers, applications, and dependencies via CM tools |
| Release & Deployment Management | Automate deployments with CI/CD |

---

## 🐧 3. Basic ITIL/Agile Example in DevOps

**Scenario:** Production Issue Resolution

1. **Incident Raised:** Monitoring alert via Grafana/Prometheus  
2. **Incident Logging:** Create ticket in ServiceNow (ITIL)  
3. **Root Cause Analysis:** DevOps engineer uses logs & metrics to identify problem  
4. **Resolution:** Hotfix deployed via Jenkins pipeline  
5. **Review:** Update knowledge base & CI/CD pipeline to prevent recurrence  

✅ Integrates **Agile speed with ITIL structure** for reliable service delivery.

## ⚡ 4. Advanced Agile & ITIL in DevOps

### 🔹 Agile + DevOps
- **Shift-left testing:** Test early in CI pipeline  
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Treat infrastructure as versioned code  
- **Continuous Feedback:** Use monitoring and logging to improve sprints  

### 🔹 ITIL + DevOps
- **Automated Change Management:** Trigger changes automatically from pipelines  
- **CMDB Integration:** Track configuration items in real time using Ansible/Puppet/Chef  
- **Service Level Monitoring:** Use Prometheus & Grafana to track SLA compliance  
- **Continuous Service Improvement:** Analyze incidents & automate preventive measures  

---

## 🧩 5. Real-World DevOps Example

**Scenario:** CI/CD Pipeline with Agile & ITIL Practices

1. **Agile:** Developers commit features via sprint-based user stories  
2. **CI/CD:** Jenkins pipeline builds, tests, and deploys code  
3. **Monitoring:** Prometheus & Grafana track application performance  
4. **ITIL Incident Management:** Alerts auto-create tickets in ServiceNow  
5. **Change Management:** Pipeline triggers approval workflows for production deployment  
6. **CSI:** Analyze incidents, optimize pipeline, and improve service delivery  

✅ Combines **Agile flexibility with ITIL governance** for end-to-end DevOps excellence.

---

## 🏁 6. Hands-on Lab

**Task:** Integrate Agile & ITIL in DevOps Pipeline

1. Use **Jira** for backlog and sprint management  
2. Setup **Jenkins CI/CD pipeline** for automated builds & deployments  
3. Integrate **ServiceNow** for incident and change management  
4. Monitor application with **Prometheus/Grafana**  
5. Implement feedback loop to improve future sprints and services
